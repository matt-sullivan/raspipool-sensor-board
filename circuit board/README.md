Raspberry Pi sensor board for measuring a pools pH, ORP and temperature based on an LMP7721 ultra low current op amp, ADS1119 analog to digital converter and ADM3260 power & i2c isolator. (Each sensor needs to be electrically isolated, they won't work if there's any voltages between grounds etc.)

Based on https://github.com/reef-pi/pH-Board, but duplicated for 2 channels, and added a header for mounting directly on a raspberry pi.
